# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
I created a program that would take all items purchased in a day from a grocery store and give quantities for each object. The user can display the whole list, search for specific items and display their quantities, or print a histogram with asterisk symbols for quantities. 

# What did you do particularly well?
I think I did well utilizing the strengths of C++ and Python in this project. C++ is used for the user interaction of the program while Python handles the data analysis portion. 

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could enhance the Python code by creating a separate function to get input from the file and calculate quantities of each item so there is less repeated code in the other functions that are called from C++ to make the code more efficient. 

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I found the histogram portion most challenging in this program after Python would put the information in the file for C++ to read, I didn't remember how to properly divide the input to their appropriate variables. I went back to the reading for reference to this and will remember this way for the future. 

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or coursework?
Other than the skills from overall properly integrating Python and C++ into one project, I did need to work on my skills for input validation. It's something that will definitely be needed in future programs and it was somewhat challenging finding a suitable approach for how the input needed to be validated whether it was only accepting numerical input or not accepting numerical input. 

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The code is easily readable with the use of industry-standard commenting, naming, and whitespace. This should make the code easily maintainable in the future to modify or extend it as needs change. It's very adaptable as it could be used in other situations for inventory management or item tracking.
